# kmeansCluster
A algorithm for cluster
This is algoryithm for cluster
The data foramt is like:

5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2
5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2
5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4
4.6,3.4,1.4,0.3
5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2

You can dowolaod the .py file and enter into the ralative dic
   python keemensCluster -i inputfile -n clusterNum -t iterationNum
